This code realizes a game, where there is a board of lamps which are all initially off. The size of the board is set by the user at the beginning of the game. Each click on an off lamp turns it on and vice versa. The goal of the game is to set the whole board on. The challenge is that four neighboring lamps of the lamp on which the user has clicked, change into on or off depending on their previous states.
